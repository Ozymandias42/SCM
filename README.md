# [WIP] Config Manager

---
# Archived and dropped.

### _This project aims to be a more secure and general replacement for dotfile managers that allows to treat system files differently, i.e. allow to symlink them like normal dotfile-managers without allowing write-access to the source-files to the current user_

Now in a usable state, though not yet finished.
Requires Functional-Bash  
https://github.com/Ozymandias42/Functional-Bash

Functional-Bash can be sourced from anywhere, just change the first line of SCM accordingly.
